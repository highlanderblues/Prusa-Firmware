Technical support told me to prevent you
I've a mk3 (since feb 2019) updated to Mk3S. When running wizard with new firmware 3.6.0 (after 3.5.1), I get an error on fantest (front one).
Everything checked .. wires, conections
Returning to firmware 3.5.1, everything works fine (Seen other people on forum having same troubles)
